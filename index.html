        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently in the process of obtaining my degree at the University of California, Riverside. As of now, I have completed one full college year here at this university; thus making me a second-year CHASS student majoring in Political Science. I made the decision to major in Political Science because, in a couple of years, I plan to be a criminal defense attorney. Not only that, but I feel as though it is best to obtain some knowledge of politics, especially in our current political climate that we live in. To continue from my previous statement of what I strive to accomplish as my future career, I want to be a criminal defense attorney for many reasons. One important reason as to why I would like to be a criminal defense attorney is the fact that I believe that there are many injustices that occur in the legal system. It is no secret that racist ideologies have become justifications for the exploitation of people of color, which is what shaped our laws and decision-makers in our criminal justice system for centuries. Once I become a criminal defense attorney, I would have some type of power in aiding the people to a more idealistic pathway to a better lifestyle compared to the continuous cycle of throwing those in prison to be caged up, instead of providing rehabilitation. Too many people of color are getting thrown into cells for a longer sentence than those who have done much worse due to the color of their skin. I want to make a difference and become the change we have all wanted to see in the twisted system we currently have. Instead of seeing these defendants as criminals, I prefer to see them as good people who made mistakes. With this mindset implemented, more people would encourage rehabilitation over prison terms. 
 
 <br><br>
 Growing up, my family had a very driven work ethic in the sense that they are constantly being proactive and striving to attain their goals no matter how challenging the journey may be. No matter the obstacles they always find efficient ways to get their tasks done. Not only that but when it came to their jobs, they were always motivated to work and willing to put in the hard work and give it their full attention and dedication. My family members are not ones to put in half the work and expect all the benefits. Instead, they put in every ounce of effort they can in order to reach their desired outcome. With this being my environment growing up, it is not a surprise to anyone that as soon as I turned sixteen I quickly went on the hunt for locations that were hiring and willing to hire minors. Unfortunately, the hunt for a job took as long as a year for me. It is rather difficult to find a job as young as I was with no experience at all, which is the case for many individuals like myself. Many places hiring were looking for workers who were already familiar with the workplace environment. By the time I turned seventeen, I was able to finally snatch a job interview and successfully get hired for the position. Although it took me a year, with my dedication, I was able to continue forth with my hunt for jobs and eventually obtained one. I knew better than to give up because even though I had to go through such a long journey filled with multiple rejections I was eventually able to land a job that is the right fit for me. The job that I got and still currently have is an usher position at the San Gabriel Mission Playhouse.

        With this job experience, I was able to develop and master new skills. I am someone who loves to learn new things, so I was excited to have this opportunity to prove I was capable of adapting. Some of the skills that I have acquired over the years would be that I have the ability to stay calm when under pressure and to execute the needed tasks without error. There were many instances at work when a problem would occur and I would have to step in and find a solution. Making sure that every task I had was completed with no mistakes was extremely important to me because the quality of my work is what I am proud of the most. Not only that but since my job requires me to come in contact with many different people, I am also able to have good communication skills in the sense that I can easily adapt in any given situation with any type of person with ease. Being able to work with others while getting work done is essential to adulthood. This is because there will always be jobs where I have to team up with other people, which is why I am extremely grateful this job gave me the experience. If there is a situation where people are having a conflict I now know how to handle it in a professional manner. To continue, I also have the skill of getting the job done fairly quickly without leaving room for error. Due to the constant requirement of helping multiple people at once, it explains why I was able to pick up that skill of being quick and efficient with whatever work is given to me. Work is always one task after another with little to no time in between for a breather. Being able to gain this skill was game changing because I am now able to multitask at a quicker pace.
